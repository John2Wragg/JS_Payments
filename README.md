# JS_Payments
Creating a Chrome extension using javascript to log monthly transactions and keep track of payments. 
HTML and CSS / Bootstrap styling are used to create the layout. Javascript is used to create the functionality (event listeners, save variables, add input to JS Objects and re-output the HTML to reflect user interaction). 
The 'monthly balance' can be changed directly in the JS file where the variables are declared at the top.
